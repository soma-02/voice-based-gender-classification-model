# voice-based-gender-classification-model

It is a machine learning application used to trace the gender(male or female) based on acoustic data i.e pitch,median,frequency.

# Working

Developed 5 different algorithms to trace the gender and identified the best fit model is Random Forest in terms of accuracy.
The algorithms are Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM.  

# Process
1) import libraries
2) data selection and preprocessing
3) split data into trainset and testset
4) label visualization
5) model training using 5 different algorithms
6) identifying best classifier
